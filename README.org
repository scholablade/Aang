#+Title: The Aang Programming Language
Aang is a purely functional programming language with Arithemtic types meaning negative and fractional types, the dual of sum and product types, Aang is a Haskell literate program using what I call, "Denotative Relational Literate Programming", Aang is embedded via denotative embedding, a combination of tagless-final, deeper shallow embedding and denotational semantics.
Aang is in heavy development.

The source is simply ~Aang.org~, it is a single text file comprising of prose and source code, for 
development on Aang, I recommend you setup Emacs with org-mode.
